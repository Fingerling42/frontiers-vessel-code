Drone on Volga mission Robonomics model
=======================================

This model to order measurement mission from Drone on Volga surface vehicle.
Vessel could navigate near Togliatti city shore.
Vessel execute mission by given waypoints and with sensors specified by customer.
Virtual missions possible to use previously measured data.

Expected objective
------------------

| Topic       | Message Type | Description |
| ------------| ------------ | ----------- |
| /waypoints  | std_msgs/String | A string consists IPFS hash of mission waypoints file aquired from APM Planner to execute by navigation and motion control system |
| /sensors    | std_msgs/String | Comma separated list of sensors to use. Possible values: Temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Conductivity, Cu2+, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+ |
| /virtual    | std_msgs/Bool | If False, means robot must execute this mission after liability contract issued. If True, robot could simulate mission and provide previously measured data |
| /expiration | std_msgs/Duration | Historical data expiration time for virtual missions. If robot have measurements made after (Liability Contract Block Time - Experation) time it could use it for virtual missions |

Expected result

| Topic         | Message Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| /geo          | std_msgs/String | Actual geoposition |
| /sensors      | std_msgs/String | WaspFrame format string with values measured |
| /geo_file     | std_msgs/String | For virtual missions. A string consists IPFS hash of geopositioning log file. Could be rosbag or raw text file with EOL separated strings with <epoch time> <geoposition> pairs |
| /sensors_file | std_msgs/String | For virtual missions. A string consists IPFS hash of sensors log file. Could be rosbag or raw text file with EOL separated WaspFrame format strings with <epoch time> <values measured> paris |
